          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the uGrant website (ugrant.co.uk) and our eligibility checking services ("Services"). By using our website or Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please read these Terms carefully before using our Services. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use our Services.
          </p>

          <h2>2. About uGrant</h2>
          <p>
            uGrant provides an eligibility checking service for UK energy efficiency schemes. We help users determine potential eligibility for government-backed energy schemes and, where requested, connect them with approved installer partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> uGrant is not affiliated with or endorsed by any government body. We are an independent service that helps facilitate connections between eligible households and energy scheme installers.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Eligibility Information</h2>
          <h3>3.1 Indicative Results</h3>
          <p>
            The eligibility results provided by our Service are indicative only and based on the information you provide. Final eligibility determination is made by the relevant scheme administrators and installers based on a full assessment of your property and circumstances.
          </p>

          <h3>3.2 No Guarantee</h3>
          <p>
            We do not guarantee that you will receive any grants, discounts, or improvements as a result of using our Service. Eligibility criteria for energy schemes may change, and final decisions rest with the scheme providers and installers.
          </p>

          <h3>3.3 Accuracy of Information</h3>
          <p>
            You are responsible for providing accurate and complete information when using our eligibility checker. Providing false or misleading information may affect your eligibility and could constitute fraud.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Our Services</h2>
          <h3>4.1 Eligibility Checking</h3>
          <p>
            Our eligibility checker uses the information you provide to assess potential eligibility for various energy efficiency schemes. This assessment is based on publicly available eligibility criteria and is provided for informational purposes.
          </p>

          <h3>4.2 Installer Connections</h3>
          <p>
            If you request to be connected with installers, we will share your contact information with approved installer partners who operate in your area. These installers are independent businesses and not employees or agents of uGrant.
          </p>

          <h3>4.3 No Installation Services</h3>
          <p>
            uGrant does not provide installation services. All installation work is performed by independent installer partners. We are not responsible for the quality, timing, or outcome of any installation work.
          </p>

          <h2>5. User Obligations</h2>

          <h3>6.1 Independent Contractors</h3>
          <p>
            Installer partners are independent contractors and not employees, agents, or representatives of uGrant. We do not control their work, schedules, or business practices.
          </p>

          <h3>6.2 Vetting</h3>
          <p>
            We endeavour to work only with installers who hold appropriate accreditations (such as TrustMark registration and PAS certification). However, we cannot guarantee the quality of their work or their continued compliance with industry standards.
          </p>

          <h3>6.3 Disputes with Installers</h3>
          <p>
